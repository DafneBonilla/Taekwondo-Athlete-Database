## Explanation

<div align="justify">
This database was designed to save data of taekwondo athletes with the intention of doing it formally, that is, as it is done in international professional taekwondo competitions, where the most important characteristics are age, weight to assign the category of competitor's bout, the athlete's kup grade and the country he represents. In addition, the age of an athlete who competes professionally goes from 16 to 35 years as a maximum (for reasons of physical performance) and a weight that goes from 40.00 kg (minimum) to enter the lightest category at 90.00 kg (maximum) to enter the heaviest category.
